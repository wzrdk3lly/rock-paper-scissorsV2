# rock-paper-scissorsV2
Overview: I created a rock, paper, scissors game where you will play against the computer.
## What I learned
- toggling event listeners for game-play state
- git branching
- integrating new functionality into console/command like code
- importance of refactoring + continuos program improvement
- Manipulating the DOM git

## Potential improvements
-  Replace buttons with pictures representing each move
-  Create a score for the amount of games won.
-  Can you save score and come back. Is there a way to use cookies/cache to save this?
-  Fix any bugs
