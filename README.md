# rock-paper-scissorsV2
Overview: I am creating a simple console game where users can play rock paper scissors.
## Potential improvements
-  Add a score board
-  Add instructions on how to win
-  Replace buttons with pictures representing each move
-  Add motivation comments to keep a user engaged
-  Create a score for the amount of games won.
-  Can you save score and come back. Is there a way to use cookies/cache to save this
